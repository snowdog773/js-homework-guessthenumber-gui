# Guess The Number Game (GUI)

Here we have four files to consider: `index.html`, `GuessTheNumber.js`,
`main.js`, and `random.js`.

We need not worry about coding inside of `GuessTheNumber.js` and `random.js` but,
have a good gander and make sure you understand both files.

Next, we take a look at `index.html`. This provides a *view* for our Guess The
Number game. Using `main.js`, we need to grab the HTML elements necessary and
listen to a few click events and act accordingly.

This way, instead of typing in a terminal or in the browser's console, we can
play our game using a graphical user interface (GUI for short. Pronounced
"Gooey").

Have fun!
